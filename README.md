# Blog Post

I wrote a [blog post](https://www.danbuilds.us/blog/unemployment-reminders) about the 
idea behind the project and the development process.

# Developers

For developers interested in collaborating on this project there are some rough 
instructions [here](docs/DEVELOPERS.md). I'm sure there are some steps missing 
from the docs so feel free to reach out with any questions.

This is my first python project so I'd be happy to entertain pull requests, feature 
ideas, and code reviews.

If you happen to work at an awesome company I'm also [looking for a job](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danbuilds/).
